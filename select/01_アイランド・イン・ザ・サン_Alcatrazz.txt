They named it the rock, land ofThe living dead
A repose for the rich and famous All
The infamous would tell each other'sLies
Why did they want to tell the truth
On an island in the sun
Cool pacific winds blow
Most were poets and they wrote in Basic prose
On the walls of their sunset blvd.
In their nine by five rooms, became Inspired
By the silence in sight of the city On an island in the sun
Cool pacific winds blow
Just across the bay
Battered by the waves change
